## Local Applications to test out the Google Machine Learning APIs

To run the examples, do the following steps:

 - Install the dependencies that are present in the `package.json` file via the following command:
   `npm install --save`
 - Open `config/index.js` file and fill in the correct values for your Google Project id that is enabled for all the Machine Learning APIs. Also provide your Service Account keyfile in JSON format. For more information on getting a Service Account Key file, refer to the following [document](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).
 - You can then visit the respective folders for each of the sample and run it via `node <filename.js>` command.
