Deadpool 2 Review: Does he die? Does he not? Or does he? The Basanti of superheroes is back and must form a team (X-Force) of his own. Since this is an R rated film, we don’t mind saying the following. It takes ba**s to come right after Avengers: Infinity War, one of the biggest superhero movies of all time and sh** on its star power by presenting a film that’s more entertaining, engaging, relatable and immersive (without relying on 3D). Led by a flawed and disfigured superhero, the action-comedy scores without the crutch of big faces or the usual superhero trappings.

Audaciously crafted and cleverly written, Deadpool 2 has the ability to end the Avengers’ reign at the box office. Credit goes to the writers for ensuring that the constant wisecracks, digs at other superheroes or pop culture references, don’t distract a viewer from the story’s emotional core and it’s protagonist’s moral ambiguity.

While the action is brilliantly shot and executed, the comedy smartly doubles up as a social commentary on racism, sexism, body shaming and sexual harassment.

Boasting of some great unsuspecting cameos, the story humanises Deadpool, without letting go of what makes him different — deviant ways, indulgence in gory violence, sarcasm and narcissism. However, what stands out the most are the hilarious opening credits and post-credits scenes, perhaps the best in Marvel movie history.

Ably supported by Lady Luck Domino (Zazie Beetz), Reynolds does for you what the recent superhero orgy did with the help of infinite characters and infinity stones (pun intended). The actor-writer surpasses his own 2016 outing with this smashing sequel that has its heart and humour in the right place.
